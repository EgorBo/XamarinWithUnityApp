# XamarinWithUnityApp
A Xamarin.Android app with Unity as a lib (a new feature in Unity 2019.3.a2, see this [blog post](https://blogs.unity3d.com/ru/2019/06/17/add-features-powered-by-unity-to-native-mobile-apps/) and these [steps](https://forum.unity.com/threads/integration-unity-as-a-library-in-native-android-app.685240/)).
So you can now easily add a Unity scene (e.g. ARCore scene) to any native or Xamarin app via `.aar` file.

The Unity `*.aar` file with this simple scene is 17 mb. So the total APK size for this sample is 26mb.
